# Cloud-JEE-Project-CRUD
Cloud JEE project CRUD services
The objective of this project is to create an application that manages a university department. 
This application offers three features, namely:
Students management;
Professors management;
Administrative staff management;
Each lot must offer at least the following set of features:
A CRUD (Create Retrieve Update Delete) in order to manage the actors in question;
Statistics relating to the actors (eg. Absenteeism rate Success rate for students).

The technological constraints imposed for this project are as follows:
1. The use of the J2EE platform is mandatory for the Backend;
2. SOAP Web Services and REST Web Services must be implemented in order to implement all the above-mentioned functionalities and they must be deployed on a GlassFish server;
3. Data storage and retrieval must be done via a DBMS (you are free to choose the DBMS that you think is appropriate). A database design is then required.

Technical tools  :
Programming language: JEE
• Application server: Glassfish 4.1.1
• Text editor: Netbeans 8.1
• DBMS: Mysql
