# Cloud-JEE-Project-CRUD
## Introduction
The objective of this project is to create an application that manages a university department. 
This application offers three features, namely:
* Students management
* Professors management
* Administrative staff management

Each lot must offer at least the following set of features:
* A CRUD (Create Retrieve Update Delete) in order to manage the actors in question;
* Statistics relating to the actors (eg. Absenteeism rate Success rate for students).

**The technological constraints imposed for this project are as follows:**
1. The use of the J2EE platform is mandatory for the Backend;
2. SOAP Web Services and REST Web Services must be implemented in order to implement all the above-mentioned functionalities and they must be deployed on a GlassFish server;
3. Data storage and retrieval must be done via a DBMS (you are free to choose the DBMS that you think is appropriate). A database design is then required.

**Technical tools  :**
* Programming language: JEE
* Application server: Glassfish 4.1.1
* Text editor: Netbeans 8.1
* DBMS: Mysql
